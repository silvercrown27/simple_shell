# Simple Shell Project

This is a simple terminal-like shell project that aims to recreate the functionality of a basic Unix shell. The shell allows users to interact with the underlying operating system by executing commands and managing processes. This readme file provides an overview of the project and answers some important questions related to the shell's functionality.
